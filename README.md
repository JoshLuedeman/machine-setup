# Machine Setup
This is a set of scripts I use to configure a new machine when I get it. These scripts are setup to run in different environments, depending on the machine.

## Machine OS
| OS | Script Language | Status | Link |
|-|-|-|-|
|Windows|PowerShell|**Released**| [Link](./Windows/README.md) |
|Linux|Bash|*In Planning*| [Link](./Linux/README.md)|

## Installation
The goal will be that for installation, the documentation for each OS will have instructions for how to use a command like wget to pull the needed script and how to run it to setup your machine.
